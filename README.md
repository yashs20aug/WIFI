# WIFI
Indoor Positioning System aims at locating positions inside buildings wirelessly using a WIFI fingerprint, which can be characterized by the detected Wireless Access Points (WAPs) and the corresponding Received Signal Strength Intensity (RSSI)

# Problem Statement:
Evaluate the application of machine learning techniques to the problem of
indoor positioning via WIFI fingerprinting and compare the performance of
various models. A client is developing a system to be deployed on large
industrial campuses, in shopping malls, et cetera to help people to navigate a
complex, unfamiliar interior space without getting lost. While GPS works
reliably outdoors, it generally doesn't work indoors, so a different technology is
necessary. The client would like us to investigate the feasibility of using "WIFI
fingerprinting" to determine a person's location in indoor spaces. WIFI
fingerprinting uses the signals from multiple WIFI hotspots within the building
to determine location, analogously to how GPS uses satellite signals.
